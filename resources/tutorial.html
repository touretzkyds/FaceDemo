<h5 style="text-align: left">Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</h5>

<p>
  The face detector in this demonstration is a <b>deep convolutional
  neural network</b>.  It's "deep" because it has many layers.  It's
  "convolutional" because it applies a collection of templates called
  "kernels" at every position in the input array, a process called
  "convolution".  Many of these kernels are simple 3x3 arrays; some
  have a different shape, such as 1x1x16.  To learn more about deep
  convolutional neural networks, see these resources: <p/>

<h5 style="text-align: left;">The TinyYoloV2 Architecture</h5>

<p>
  The deep convolutional neural network used in this face detection
  demo is TinyYOLOV2.  YOLO, or You Only Look Once, is a neural
  network architecture for identifying objects in images.  TinyYOLO is
  a scaled-down version that uses fewer units and thus fits more
  easily on small devices such as cellphones.  TinyYOLOV2 is version 2
  of the TinyYOLO architecture.  Figure 1 below shows the structure of
  TinyYOLOV2.  <p/>

    </div>

<p>
  The input layer of the neural net is a 224 x 224 color image with R,
  G, and B channels.  Hence, the input has dimension 224 x 224 x 3.

<h5 style="text-align: left;">Layout of the Demo</h5>

<p>Figure 2 shows the layout of the demo.  Only two of the internal
layers of the network are displayed: convolutional layer 1, and
max-pooling layer 4.  We also display the input layer (as an RGB
image) and the output layer (as bounding boxes).<p/>

<h5 style="text-align: left;">First Convolutional Layer</h5>

<p>
  The first convolutional layer, labeled conv1 in Figure 1, uses 3x3
  kernels that examine all three input channels, so the kernel size is
  3x3x3, or [3,3,3] in our preferred notation.  Each kernel is applied
  to every pixel position in the image, i.e., the spacing or "stride"
  is 1.  And there are 16 such kernels.  Thus, the entire description
  of the conv1 layer is [3,3,3]/1 x 16.  The output of the conv1 layer
  has shape 224 x 224 and is 16 channels deep, so it has shape 224 x
  224 x 16.
</p>

<p>
  The demo allows you to examine any three of the sixteen conv1
  kernels simultaneously.  Each kernel has a 3x3 pattern of weights
  for each of the three input channels R, G, and B, so a conv1
  kernel's shape is 3x3x3.  Since weights can be either positive or
  negative, we use opponent colors to display the kernels graphically.
  For the R channel we use red for positive weights and cyan (green +
  blue) for negative weights.  Similarly, to show the G channel we use
  green for positive weights and magenta (red + blue) for negative
  weights, and for the B channel we use blue for positive weights and
  yellow (red + green) for negative weights.  The output of each
  kernel is a single numerical value for each pixel, so it is
  displayed as a grayscale image.
</p>

<p>
  The conv1 kernels are simple feature detectors that appear to be
  looking for intensity edges or color blobs.  It's impossible to say
  exactly what each kernel is doing because there may be subtleties to
  the weights that aren't captured by these simplistic descriptions,
  but here is a summary of all 16 kernels in the conv1 layer:
</p>

<ol>
  <li value=0> Yellow edege detector </li>
  <li> Yellow patch detector </li>
  <li> Green patch detector / oriented edge detector </li>
  <li> (Haar-like feature) </li>
  <li> Horizontal edge detector (black over white) </li>
  <li> Negative image </li>
  <li> Yellow edge detector </li>
  <li> Diagonal edge detector </li>
  <li> Horizontal edge detector </li>
  <li> Vertical edge detector </li>
  <li> Horizontal edge detector </li>
  <li> Red patch detector </li>
  <li> Blue-green patch detector </li>
  <li> Vertical edge detector </li>
  <li> Black/orange horizontal edge detector </li>
  <li> Black/yellow vertical edge detector </li>
</ol>  

<h5 style="text-align: left;">First Max-Pooling Layer</h5>

<p>
  The first convolutional layer (conv1) layer feeds into the first
  max-pooling layer (max1).  Each unit in max1 examines a 2x2 patch of
  the conv1 output and computes the max of those 4 values.  This is
  done separately for each of the 16 channels, so the "kernel" size is
  2x2x1.  (We put "kernel" in quotes because max-pooling layers don't
  have adjustable weights; all the kernels are effectively 1 and it's
  the max function that does the work.)  The kernel is applied at
  every other pixel position, so the stride is 2.  Thus the full
  description of the max1 layer configuration is [2,2,1]/2 x 16.  With
  a stride of 2 we are subsampling the image, so the output of the
  max1 layer is smaller than the input but has the same number of
  channels; it has shape 112&nbsp;x&nbsp;112&nbsp;x&nbsp;16.
</p>


<h5 style="text-align: left;">Full, Depth-Wise, and Point-Wise Convolutions</h5>

<p>
  The first convolutional layer (conv1), shown in purple, is a full
  convolution.  Each kernel examines a 3x3 image patch across all 3
  channels (R,G,B).  Thus each kernel has 3x3x3 = 27 independent
  parameters.  There are 16 of these kernels.
</p>

<p>
  Later convolutional layers have larger numbers of channels, so the
  YOLO architecture uses a trick to reduce the number of parameters.
  The trick, called "separable convolutions", replaces each full
  convolution with two partial convolutions.  A depth-wise convolution
  (shown in dark blue) applies a 3x3 kernel to a single channel, so it
  has only 9 parameters.  Then, a point-wise convolution (shown in
  light blue) uses a 1-pixel kernel that examines all channels, so the
  number of parameters per kernel is equal to the number of input
  channels.
</p>

<p>
  Let's look at the second and third convolutional layers in Figure 1.
  The input to conv2 is of size 112 x 112 x 16; the output of conv3 is
  of size 112 x 112 x 32 because it has 32 output channels.  In a full
  convolution, each kernel would have 3x3x16 = 144 independent
  parameters, and with 32 such kernels we would have a total of 4,608
  parameters.  Instead we decompose the problem into a depth-wise and
  a point-wise convolution.  The conv2 depth-wise convolution layer
  has 16 3x3 kernels, giving it a total of 144 parameters, while the
  conv3 point-wise convolution layer has 32 1-pixel kernels that each
  examine all 16 of the channels produced by conv2, giving conv3 32x16
  = 512 parameters.  Thus conv2 and conv3 together have a combined
  total of only 656 parameters.  Reducing the number of parameters
  reduces the size of the neural network (so it takes less space and
  can process images more quickly) and imposes constraints that make
  it easier to train.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: left;">Fourth Max-Pooling Layer</h5>

<p>
  The fourth max-pooling layer operates on the output of conv7, the
  7th convolutional layer.  Due to the effects of repeated
  convolutions and max-pooling, at this level of the network each
  pixel is driven by a 46x46 patch of pixels in the input image, and
  the features being computed in these 128 channels are more complex
  and abstract than the conv1 layer features.  It's difficult to
  concisely describe what these features encode, but several of them
  appear to be eye detectors.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: left;">Output Layer</h5>

<p>
  The output layer of TinyYOLOV2 produces a set of bounding boxes for
  candidate faces.  The output is organized as a 7x7 grid.  Each grid
  cell contains 25 units that describe five bounding boxes using five
  parameters each: x, y, w, h, and c.  The x, y values give the center of
  the bounding box relative to the grid square; the w, h values give
  the width and height of the bounding box; the c value is the
  confidence that the bounding box contains a face.  Figure 3 shows
  this output structure.
</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img class="center-content" style="align-content: center;" src="bounding_boxes.png" width="500" alt="Architecture of TinyYOLOV2">
        <p>Figure 3: Organization of output layer bounding boxes.</p>
    </div>

<p>
The five bounding box detectors at each grid location are biased for
different scales.  In the bounding box display, the color of the box
tells you which of the five detectors is responding: red for distant
(small) faces, cyan for medium distant faces, yellow for medium close
faces, green for really close faces, and magenta for faces that are so
close they don't completely fit in the image.  As you move closer to
or further away from the camera, the bounding box color will change.
